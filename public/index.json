The analysis will cover identifying the malicious processes, locating malware, and tracing its communication with external servers\nScenario #\rAn after-hours alert from the Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) system flags suspicious activity on a Windows workstation. The flagged malware aligns with the Amadey Trojan Stealer. Your job is to analyze the presented memory dump and create a detailed report for actions taken by the malware.\nSolution #\rIn the memory dump analysis, determining the root of the malicious activity is essential for comprehending the extent of the intrusion. What is the name of the parent process that triggered this malicious behavior? First, I used windows.pslist and windows.pstree to list all processes and to visualize the parent-child process relationships:\nvol.py -f ../../Artifacts/Windows\\ 7\\ x64-Snapshot4.vmem windows.pslist # all processes vol.py -f ../../Artifacts/Windows\\ 7\\ x64-Snapshot4.vmem windows.pstree # parent child processes relations I found lssass.exe to be associated with the suspicious parent process rundll32.exe, indicating this as the root of the malicious behavior..\nlssass.exe\n2.Once the rogue process is identified, its exact location on the device can reveal more about its nature and source. Where is this process housed on the workstation?\nNext, I used windows.filescan to find the location of the malware:\n/vol.py -f ../../Artifacts/Windows\\ 7\\ x64-Snapshot4.vmem windows.filescan | grep \u0026#34;lssass.exe\u0026#34; C:\\Users\\0XSH3R~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\925e7e99c5\\lssass.exe\nPersistent external communications suggest the malware’s attempts to reach out C2C server. Can you identify the Command and Control (C2C) server IP that the process interacts with? So, i used windows.netscan\nvol.py -f ../../Artifacts/Windows\\ 7\\ x64-Snapshot4.vmem windows.netscan | grep \u0026#34;lssass.exe\u0026#34; 41.75.84.12\nFollowing the malware link with the C2C, the malware is likely fetching additional tools or modules. How many distinct files is it trying to bring onto the compromised workstation? I tried to dump malicious Process:\nvol.py -f ../../Artifacts/Windows\\ 7\\ x64-Snapshot4.vmem windows.memmap.Memmap --pid 2748 --dump So after dumping the process i used strings command to extract HTTP GET Requests:\nstrings pid.2748.dmp | grep -A 5 -i \u0026#34;^get /\u0026#34; The answer is: 2\nIdentifying the storage points of these additional components is critical for containment and cleanup. What is the full path of the file downloaded and used by the malware in its malicious activity? From Q4 we known that the attacker downloaded another 2 malicious files named :\ncred64.dll clip64.dll I used windows.filescan to find the location of the second malware:\n/vol.py -f ../../Artifacts/Windows\\ 7\\ x64-Snapshot4.vmem windows.filescan | grep \u0026#34;clip64.dll\u0026#34; c:\\Users\\0xSh3rl0ck\\AppData\\Roaming\\116711e5a2ab05\\clip64.dll\nOnce retrieved, the malware aims to activate its additional components. Which child process is initiated by the malware to execute these files? From question n°5:\nRUNDLL32.EXE\n7.Understanding the full range of Amadey’s persistence mechanisms can help in an effective mitigation. Apart from the locations already spotlighted, where else might the malware be ensuring its consistent presence?\nvol.py -f ../../Artifacts/Windows\\ 7\\ x64-Snapshot4.vmem windows.filescan | grep \u0026#34;lssass.exe\u0026#34; c:\\Windows\\System32\\Tasks\\lssass.exe\n~ Carbo\n","date":"7 September 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/amadayelab-cyberdefenders/","section":"Posts \u0026 Writeups","summary":"","title":"Amadey Lab - Cyberdefenders","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"7 September 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/","section":"Carbo's Blog","summary":"","title":"Carbo's Blog","type":"page"},{"content":"","date":"7 September 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/cyberdefenders/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Cyberdefenders","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"7 September 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/forensics/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Forensics","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"7 September 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/memory-dump/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Memory-Dump","type":"tags"},{"content":" ","date":"7 September 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/","section":"Posts \u0026 Writeups","summary":"","title":"Posts \u0026 Writeups","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"7 September 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"7 September 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/volatility3/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Volatility3","type":"tags"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/authors/","section":"Authors","summary":"","title":"Authors","type":"authors"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/categories/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Categories","type":"categories"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/series/","section":"Series","summary":"","title":"Series","type":"series"}]
